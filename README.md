Here are my TouchDesigner project samples and TOX files that included some GLSL shaders-related features and the combination between them:

- MatCap
- ReactiveVertex
- AudioAnalysis
- DeferredLighting
- ToneMap
- HDR
- particles with forces from .bhclassic files
- VolumetricLighting (not working for now)
